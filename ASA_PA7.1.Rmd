If you are using R 3.6.0 or later, the following command will ensure that the random number generator being used is the same as in prior versions of R. Because these modules were developed using R 3.5.0, output that depends on random numbers used the older generator. Running this code will have your output match that shown in the modules.


```{r}
# Run this chunk if using R 3.6.0 or later.
RNGkind(sample.kind = "Rounding")
```

If you are using R 4.0.0 or later, the following command will ensure that read.csv() interprets variables whose values are characters as factor variables. This was the default behavior in prior versions of R. All code is written assuming such variables are factor variables.

```{r}
# Run this chunk if using R 4.0.0 or later. You may get what looks like an error message. It can be ignored.
options(stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
```

Run CHUNK 1 to see some simulated data used in Exercise 7.1.1.

```{r}
# CHUNK 1
x <- matrix(runif(10000), 5000, 2)
plot(x, col = ifelse(x[, 1] > .6 & x[, 2] > .5, "red", "black"))
```

Run CHUNK 2 to make a single linear split where the first component is either less than or greater than or equal to 0.6.  
  
```{r}
# CHUNK 2
plot(x, col = ifelse(x[, 1] > .6 & x[, 2] > .5, "red", "black"))
abline(v = .6, col = "blue", lty = 1, lwd = 3)
```
  
Run CHUNK 3 to see the answer to the first Knowledge Check.
  
```{r}
# CHUNK 3
plot(x, col = ifelse(x[, 1] > .6 & x[, 2] > .5, "red", "black"))
abline(v = .6, col = "blue", lty = 1, lwd = 3)
segments(x0 = .6, y0 = .5, x1 = 1, y1 = .5, col = "blue", lty = 1, lwd = 3)
```

Run CHUNK 4 to simulate data for the second Knowledge Check.
  
```{r}
# CHUNK 4
set.seed(10000)
x <- matrix(runif(1000, 1, 5), 100, 2)
plot(x, type = "p", col = ifelse(x[, 1] > 3 & x[, 2] < 4, "red", (ifelse(x[, 1] <= 3 & x[, 2] < 2, "red", "black"))))
```

Run CHUNK 5 to see a graphic solution.

```{r}
# CHUNK 5
set.seed(10000)
x <- matrix(runif(1000, 1, 5), 100, 2)
plot(x, type = "p", col = ifelse(x[, 1] > 3 & x[, 2] < 4, "red", (ifelse(x[, 1] <= 3 & x[, 2] < 2, "red", "black"))))
abline(v = 3, col = "blue", lty = 1, lwd = 3)
segments(x0 = 1, y0 = 2, x1 = 3, y1 = 2, col = "blue", lty = 1, lwd = 3)
segments(x0 = 3, y0 = 4, x1 = 5, y1 = 4, col = "blue", lty = 1, lwd = 3)
```  

Run CHUNK 6 to see a new plot for Exercise 7.1.2.

```{r}
# CHUNK 6
set.seed(10000)
x <- matrix(runif(10000), 1000, 2)
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))

# Plot A
plot(x, main = "A", type = "p", col = ifelse(x[, 2] < .1, "red",
  (ifelse(x[, 1] + rnorm(2, 0, .1) < .7 & x[, 2] < .4, "red",
    (ifelse(x[, 1] + rnorm(2, 0, .1) < .4 & x[, 2] < .7, "red",
      (ifelse(x[, 1] < .1, "red",
        (ifelse(round(x[, 2], 2) == 0.6, "red",
          (ifelse(round(x[, 1], 2) == 0.8, "red", "black"))
        ))
      ))

# Plot B
set.seed(10000)
x <- matrix(runif(10000), 1000, 2)
plot(x, main = "B", type = "p", col = ifelse(x[, 2] < .1, "red",

        ))

CHUNK 7 reproduces the example in Section 23.4 of R for Everyone.

```{r}
# CHUNK 7

# Load the needed libraries.
library(rpart)
library(rpart.plot)

# The file name is german.csv as it is credit data from Germany.
credit <- read.csv(file = "german.csv")
head(credit)

# R for Everyone provides a key to decode the factor levels, we will use them as is except for re-coding the target variable, "Credit." This is needed because the data as provided is numeric and hence rpart will try and fit a regression tree and not a classification tree. As an aside, at your exam if you want to do this but are stumped regarding R commands, you could make these changes in Excel prior to reading the file in to R.

credit$Credit <- ifelse(credit$Credit == 1, "Good", "Bad")

# Fit the tree using selected variables. Parameters will take default values.
tree <- rpart(Credit ~ CreditAmount + Age + CreditHistory + Employment, data = credit)

# Display the output from fitting the tree.
tree

# Plot the tree, use ?rpart.plot in the Console to see how extra = 4 affects the output.
rpart.plot(tree, extra = 4)
```
