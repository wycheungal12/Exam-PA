If you are using R 3.6.0 or later, the following command will ensure that the random number generator being used is the same as in prior versions of R. Because these modules were developed using R 3.5.0, output that depends on random numbers used the older generator. Running this code will have your output match that shown in the modules.

```{r}
# Run this chunk if using R 3.6.0 or later.
RNGkind(sample.kind = "Rounding")
```

If you are using R 4.0.0 or later, the following command will ensure that read.csv() interprets variables whose values are characters as factor variables. This was the default behavior in prior versions of R. All code is written assuming such variables are factor variables.

```{r}
# Run this chunk if using R 4.0.0 or later. You may get what looks like an error message. It can be ignored.
options(stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
```

Use CHUNK 1 to load the ggplot2 and gridExtra libraries and the term life dataset.

```{r}
# CHUNK 1
library(ggplot2)
library(gridExtra)
term.life <- read.csv(file = "TermLife.csv")

```

Run CHUNK 2 to explore the distribution of FACE and the derived variable FACE/INCOME. The first attempt indicates a log scale on the x-axis may help. So that is done here.

```{r}
# CHUNK 2
# First we need to isolate those records where FACE is positive.
term.life.pos <- term.life[term.life$FACE > 0, ]

# Then add the derived variable.
term.life.pos$Ratio <- term.life.pos$FACE / term.life.pos$INCOME

p1 <- ggplot(data = term.life.pos) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = FACE, y = ..density..)) +
  scale_x_log10()
p2 <- ggplot(data = term.life.pos) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = Ratio, y = ..density..)) +
  scale_x_log10()
grid.arrange(p1, p2, ncol = 2)
```

It is perhaps not surprising that the face amounts are more concentrated as individuals are likely to select round numbers for their insurance purchase while income could be most any number.

Run CHUNK 3 to explore the age difference variable.

```{r}
# CHUNK 3
# We can use the full dataset here.
term.life$age.diff <- term.life$AGE - term.life$SAGE
p1 <- ggplot(data = term.life) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = age.diff, y = ..density..))
p1

# This plot looks odd. Some of the age differences are really large. Turns out the spouse age is often 0 (likely where there is no spouse). Also, there are negative values. The survey respondent could be any household member, so maybe the absolute difference is more interesting.

term.life.nonzeroSAGE <- term.life[term.life$SAGE != 0, ]
term.life.nonzeroSAGE$abs.diff <- abs(term.life.nonzeroSAGE$AGE - term.life.nonzeroSAGE$SAGE)
p2 <- ggplot(data = term.life.nonzeroSAGE) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = abs.diff, y = ..density..))
p2
```

Before looking the two education variables, we do some checking for zeros and relationships. CHUNK 4 looks at the two variables and also makes a scatterplot.

```{r}
# CHUNK 4
table(term.life$EDUCATION)
table(term.life$SEDUCATION)
ggplot(data = term.life, aes(x = EDUCATION, y = SEDUCATION)) +
  geom_point()
```

While we can't be sure about those with a low number of years of education, the 141 with SEDUCATION = 0 should be eliminated. Also, note that this is a discrete variable, as is the difference. So a histogram is not appropriate (while ages all happen to be whole numbers, it makes sense to treat age as continuous). CHUNK 5 makes a bar chart.

```{r}
# CHUNK 5
term.life.poseduc <- term.life[term.life$SEDUCATION != 0, ]
term.life.poseduc$educ.diff <- abs(term.life.poseduc$EDUCATION - term.life.poseduc$SEDUCATION)
ggplot(data = term.life.poseduc, aes(x = educ.diff)) +
  geom_bar()
```
