If you are using R 3.6.0 or later, the following command will ensure that the random number generator being used is the same as in prior versions of R. Because these modules were developed using R 3.5.0, output that depends on random numbers used the older generator. Running this code will have your output match that shown in the modules.


```{r}
# Run this chunk if using R 3.6.0 or later.
RNGkind(sample.kind = "Rounding")
```

If you are using R 4.0.0 or later, the following command will ensure that read.csv() interprets variables whose values are characters as factor variables. This was the default behavior in prior versions of R. All code is written assuming such variables are factor variables.

```{r}
# Run this chunk if using R 4.0.0 or later. You may get what looks like an error message. It can be ignored.
options(stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
```

CHUNK 1 loads some data and makes a plot.

```{r}
# CHUNK 1

library(ggplot2)
# Read in some data
intDatf <- read.csv(file = "interactionData.csv")

# If we plot the log of the  response variable (actual), we can see that relationship between
#   age and the response is different for males and females
ggplot(intDatf, aes(x = age, y = log(actual), color = sex)) +
  geom_line()
```

Run CHUNK 2 to fit a linear model without interaction.

```{r}
# CHUNK 2
glm.main.only <- glm(actual ~ sex + age, intDatf, family = Gamma(link = "log"))

# The parameter estimates are significant. This will be further discussed later in the module. For now just note that all variables are highly significant (p-values extremely small).
summary(glm.main.only)

# First, we add the predictions to the data
intDatf$pred_main_only <- predict(glm.main.only, intDatf, type = "response")

# Then we compare the predictions from our main effects only model to the actuals
# These lines are parallel because the influence of age (i.e. the slope) is independent
#   of gender.  Clearly, this differs from the actual relationships.
ggplot(intDatf) +
  geom_line(aes(x = age, y = log(pred_main_only), color = sex)) +
  geom_line(linetype = 2, aes(x = age, y = log(actual), color = sex))
```

Now run CHUNK 3 to fit a model with interaction.

```{r}
# CHUNK 3
# Note than when specifying the interaction term sex*age, the model automatically includes gender and age as main effects.
glm.interact <- glm(actual ~ sex * age, intDatf, family = Gamma(link = "log"))

# The summary shows that the sex:age interaction is significant.
summary(glm.interact)

# Or calculate the change in AIC between the two models (with and without the interaction). This again indicates the interaction has improved the model (more on AIC later).
AIC(glm.interact) - AIC(glm.main.only)

# Now we can see the slope adjustment introduced by the interaction term
intDatf$pred_interact <- predict(glm.interact, intDatf, type = "response")

ggplot(intDatf) +
  geom_line(aes(x = age, y = log(pred_interact), color = sex)) +
  geom_line(linetype = 2, aes(x = age, y = log(actual), color = sex))
```

CHUNK 4 loads the Insurance data and displays the first few values.

```{r}
# CHUNK 4

Insurance <- read.csv("Insurance.csv")
head(Insurance)

# We see that District is an integer variable, but we want to treat it as a factor.
Insurance$District <- as.factor(Insurance$District)
head(Insurance)
```

CHUNK 5 fits Poisson glms with and without offsets.

```{r}
# CHUNK 5

mod1 <- glm(Claims ~ District + Group + Age, data = Insurance, family = poisson)
mod1$coefficients
pred1 <- predict(mod1, type = "response")

# Note how an offset is treated as another predictor. Also, because it is treated as a variable, the logarithm should be used as the offset.
mod2 <- glm(Claims ~ District + Group + Age + offset(log(Holders)), data = Insurance, family = poisson)
mod2$coefficients
pred2 <- predict(mod2, type = "response")

sse1 <- sum((Insurance$Claims - pred1)^2)
sse2 <- sum((Insurance$Claims - pred2)^2)

sse1
sse2

# As expected, the offset improves the quality of the fit.
```

CHUNK 6 fits several more models to illustrate the use of weights

```{r}
# CHUNK 6
mod3 <- glm(Claims ~ District + Group + Age, data = Insurance, family = gaussian)
mod1$coefficients
pred3 <- predict(mod3, type = "response")

Insurance$AvgClaims <- Insurance$Claims / Insurance$Holders

mod4 <- glm(AvgClaims ~ District + Group + Age, data = Insurance, family = gaussian)
mod4$coefficients
pred4 <- predict(mod4, type = "response")

mod5 <- glm(AvgClaims ~ District + Group + Age, data = Insurance, weights = Holders, family = gaussian)
mod5$coefficients
pred5 <- predict(mod5, type = "response")

sse3 <- sum((Insurance$Claims - pred3)^2)
sse4 <- sum((Insurance$Claims - Insurance$Holders * pred4)^2)
sse5 <- sum((Insurance$Claims - Insurance$Holders * pred5)^2)

sse3
sse4
sse5

# Only the third of these is a proper treatment and clearly does the best, but it is not as good as the Poisson model.
```
