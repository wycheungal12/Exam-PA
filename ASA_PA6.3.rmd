If you are using R 3.6.0 or later, the following command will ensure that the random number generator being used is the same as in prior versions of R. Because these modules were developed using R 3.5.0, output that depends on random numbers used the older generator. Running this code will have your output match that shown in the modules.


```{r}
# Run this chunk if using R 3.6.0 or later.
RNGkind(sample.kind = "Rounding")
```

If you are using R 4.0.0 or later, the following command will ensure that read.csv() interprets variables whose values are characters as factor variables. This was the default behavior in prior versions of R. All code is written assuming such variables are factor variables.

```{r}
# Run this chunk if using R 4.0.0 or later. You may get what looks like an error message. It can be ignored.
options(stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
```

CHUNK 1A. Consider a simple example of an exponential curve in two dimensional space.

```{r}
# CHUNK 1A
library(ggplot2)
x1 <- runif(100, 1, 10)
x2 <- exp(x1)
df <- data.frame(x1 = x1, x2 = x2)

p1 <- ggplot(data = df, aes(x = x1, y = x2)) +
  geom_point()
p1
```

CHUNK 1B checks out a log transform.

```{r}
# CHUNK 1B
df$logx2 <- log(df$x2)
p1 <- ggplot(data = df, aes(x = x1, y = logx2)) +
  geom_point()
p1
```

CHUNK 2 provides an example of simple classification problem.

```{r}
# CHUNK 2
df <- data.frame(
  x1 = c(1, 2, 1.5, 3, 3.5, 3.5),
  x2 = c(2, 1.5, 3, 3, 3.5, 3.9),
  class = c("A", "A", "A", "B", "B", "B")
)

p1 <- ggplot(data = df, aes(x = x1, y = x2, color = class)) +
  geom_point(size = 5) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0.5, 4)) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0.5, 4)) +
  annotate("segment", x = 1.5, xend = 3.5, y = 4, yend = 1, size = 2)
p1
```

Run CHUNK 3 to see the data for a more complex classification problem. You will note that the formula for separating A and B makes it clear that a circle is the best divider. But you wouldn't know that if you only had the data and some noise had been added.

```{r}
# CHUNK 3
x1 <- runif(1000, -1, 1)
x2 <- runif(1000, -1, 1)
class <- ifelse(sqrt(x1^2 + x2^2) < 0.5, "A", "B")

df <- data.frame(x1 = x1, x2 = x2, class = class)

p1 <- ggplot(data = df, aes(x = x1, y = x2, color = class)) +
  geom_point()
p1
```

Run CHUNK 4 to see the value of a feature for this problem.

```{r}
# CHUNK 4
df$dist_from_0 <- sqrt(df$x1^2 + df$x2^2)

p2 <- ggplot(data = df, aes(x = 0, y = dist_from_0, color = class)) +
  geom_point(position = "jitter") +
  theme(
    axis.title.x = element_blank(),
    axis.text.x = element_blank(),
    axis.ticks.x = element_blank()
  ) +
  annotate("segment", x = -0.5, xend = 0.5, y = 0.5, yend = 0.5)

p2
```

CHUNK 5 has a trivial example of a feature being equal to an input variable.

```{r} 
# CHUNK 5
df <- data.frame(variable_Income = c(100000, 130000, 95000), feature_Income = c(100000, 130000, 95000))
df
```

CHUNK 6 provides an example of creating more than one feature from a single variable.

```{r}
# CHUNK 6
df <- data.frame(
  variable_occupation = c("Pediatric Nurse", "Neurosurgeon", "Carpenter"),
  feature_occupation_medical = c("TRUE", "TRUE", "FALSE"),
  feature_occupation_labor = c("FALSE", "FALSE", "TRUE")
)
df
```
   
CHUNK 7 provides an example of combining multiple variables into a single variable.
    
```{r}
# CHUNK 7
df <- data.frame(
  variable_sex = c("Female", "Male", "Male"),
  variable_smoker = c("Non-Smoker", "Non-Smoker", "Smoker"),
  feature_sex_smoker = c("Female Non-Smoker", "Male Non-Smoker", "Male Smoker")
)
df
```

CHUNK 8 reads in the mortality data, creates a target variable and summarizes the data.

```{r}
# CHUNK 8
data.mortality <- read.csv("soa_mortality_data.csv")
data.mortality$actual_q <- data.mortality$actual_face / data.mortality$exposure_face
data.mortality <- subset(data.mortality, exposure_face > 0)
nrow(data.mortality)
summary(data.mortality)
```

CHUNK 9 has some suggested transformations. Consider adding others as you develop potential features for this dataset.

```{r}
# CHUNK 9
# Log transform example
data.mortality$duration_log <- log(data.mortality$duration)

# Normalization example

data.mortality$issage_norm <- (data.mortality$issage - min(data.mortality$issage)) / (max(data.mortality$issage - min(data.mortality$issage)))

# Binned versions of variables example

data.mortality$issage_bin10 <- cut(data.mortality$issage, 10)
data.mortality$issage_bin20 <- cut(data.mortality$issage, 20, labels = FALSE) # Note the difference between using labels or not
```

CHUNK 10 provides space to binarize the categorical variables.

```{r}
# CHUNK 10

```

CHUNK 11 provides a sample binarization using the caret library.

```{r}
# CHUNK 11
library(caret)

# List the variables we want to binarize
vars.bin <- c("sex", "smoker", "prodcat", "region", "distchan", "uwkey", "uwtype", "resind_ind")

# dummyVars is not compatible with factors
for (var in vars.bin) {
  data.mortality[, var] <- as.character(data.mortality[, var])
}

# Binarize variables
# The paste function makes it easy to create the formula, it could have been typed out.
# fullRank = F implies that all values get coded. For example, for sex, both M and F will be in the binarized dataset.
binarizer <- caret::dummyVars(paste("~", paste(vars.bin, collapse = "+")), data = data.mortality, fullRank = F)
data.mortality <- cbind(
  data.mortality,
  data.frame(predict(binarizer, newdata = data.mortality))
)
```

CHUNK 12 creates two compound variables.
  
```{r}
# CHUNK 12
data.mortality$smoker_sex <- paste(data.mortality$smoker, data.mortality$sex, sep = "_")
data.mortality$smoker_sex_uwtype <- paste(data.mortality$smoker, data.mortality$sex, data.mortality$uwtype, sep = "_")
```

CHUNK 13 clears this large dataset from memory.

```{r}
rm("data.mortality")
```
